/**
  * You are given a set A containing n integers from 1 to n; A = {1,2,3,...n}.
  * Let's call P(A) as a set that contains all permutations of A;
  * For eg: if A = {1,2}. P(A) = {{1,2},{2,1}}
  * *
  * Can you find the number of elements a ∈ P(A) which satisfies following conditions:
  * *
  * For every 1 <= i <= n, a[i] ≠ i where a[i] is the ith integer in permutation a
  * There exists a set of k integers {i1, i2, i3, .... ik} such that
  * a[ij] = ij+1 ∀ j < k and a[ik] = i1 (cyclic)
  * Input Format
  * The first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test-cases.
  * T lines follow. Each line has two integers n and k separated by a single space.
  * *
  * Constraints
  * 1 <= T <= 100
  * 1 <= k <= n <= 106
  * *
  * Output Format
  * Output the remainder of the answer after divided by 1000000007 ie., ((10^9)+7)
  * *
